# Colo-Picker-Extension

This repository contains files I used to develop a color picker extension that works on my Chrome browser. The extension acts as one of my many development tools.

With this tool, you can select any color from the pixels of your browser screen and get the HEX color value copied to your clipboard immediately.

The tool can pick colors from any interface on the brwoser window. This includes from images, websites.
